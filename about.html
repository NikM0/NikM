    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Nikhil Menon.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Year 12 high school student, working towards my HSC exams in 2025.</p>
    <p>The subjects I have pursued throughout my high school years that align with my future career plans include Software Engineering, App Programming, Database Design, Physics, and Engineering Studies.</p>
    <p>My goal is to pursue and complete a Bachelor of Cyber Security, Computer Science, or Information Technology. Currently, I'm seeking work experience to gain practical insights and broaden my knowledge for future aspirations.</p>
    <p>I developed a passion for coding, scripting, and program development as early as Year 5. This early interest led me to explore and study multiple programming languages over the years, each one allowing me to create diverse projects and deepen my skills and understanding.</p>
